The traditional way to gather reliable information is to go to libraries or travel from one place to another but for today’s generation, just one click and all your information needed will be right in front of you. Through the internet, World Wide Web in specific, data and information are offered in a very easy way with the use of computer, mobile phones, tablets and many more. This is also a very convenient way for students and teachers. According to Douglas W. Green, the following would be the advantages of using World Wide Web as a research and educational tool. 
	World Wide Web as a single source for information. It allows students to gather information from a single location. Unlike the traditional way of going to the library, it can provide information orderly. 
	World Wide Web as a single library. Researchers can have a sit-down research through the World Wide Web rather than going to places like library to gather information. Gathering data from different sources like Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu and many more are a great advantage. 
	World Wide Web as Perpetual Archiving. Hard copies of data and information can be destroyed over time because of its physical properties. Information via internet can be stored to a hard disk and can last for a definite period of time. 
	Although there are some concerns regarding to this such as the quality of information where some might not be accurate, information triage where students have problems in sorting out on what they need, students and teacher will preferably choose World Wide Web because of its accessibility.

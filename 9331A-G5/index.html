                                            HTTP is an application layer protocol built on top of TCP that uses a client-server communication model. HTTP clients (such as Web browsers) and Web servers communicate via HTTP request and response messages. The three main HTTP message types are GET, POST, and HEAD.
                                            <br><br>
                                            <br>HTTP is a stateless communication protocol where servers do not keep information about clients in between request. <br>
                                            <br>HTTP provides support for other functionalities such as:<br>
                                        <ul>

                                        <br>HTTP resource are identified using URL's:<br>
                                        <br><b>Authority</b>- user information or authentication credentials; host<br>
                                        <br><b>Query</b>-Typically provided as key value pairs with apersand(&) separators or between key/values pairs. May be URL-encoded.<br> 
                                        <br><b>Fragment Identifier</b>-subsection in your document<br>
                                        <b>HTTP GET</b> messages sent to a Web server contain only a URL. Zero or more optional data parameters may be appended to the end of the URL.
                                        <br><br>  
                                        The HTTP server processes the optional data portion of the URL if present and returns the result (a Web page or element of a Web page) to the browser.
                                        <br><br>  
                                        <b>HTTP POST</b> messages place any optional data parameters in the body of the request message rather than adding them to the end of the URL.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>HTTP HEAD</b> request work the same as GET requests.

                                        <br><br><b><u>HTTP Fundamentals</u></b><br>
                                        HTTP typically runs on top of TCP/IP, using TCP port 80 by default (TCP port 443 for HTTPS).<br>
                                        HTTP resources are identified using URIs (specifically, HTTP URLs)<br>
                                        o Scheme (http: or https:)<br>
                                        o (optional) authentication information<br>
                                        o Host and (optional) port number<br>
                                        o Path (resolved to the document root on the server) to the resource<br>
                                        o (optional) scheme-specific parameters<br>
                                        o (optional) URL-encoded query<br>
                                        o (optional) bookmark (or fragment identifier)<br>

                                            <h3><u>Standard Methods</u></h3>
                                            Some standard methods of HTTP also includes: <b>PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT</b><br><br>

                                            <b>PUT</b> - The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.<br>
                                            <b>DELETE</b> - The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the Request-URI. This method MAY be overridden by human intervention (or other means) on the origin server. The client cannot be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action has been completed successfully. However, the server SHOULD NOT indicate success unless, at the time the response is given, it intends to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible location.<br>
                                            <b>OPTIONS</b> - The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or initiating a resource retrieval.<br>
                                            <b>TRACE</b> - The TRACE method is used to invoke a remote, application-layer loop- back of the request message.<br>
                                            <b>CONNECT</b> - This specification reserves the method name CONNECT for use with a proxy that can dynamically switch to being a tunnel.

                                            <h3><u>Extension Methods</u></h3>
                                            Some extension methods of HTTP also includes: <b> PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, UNLOCK, DESTINATION</b><br><br>
                                            <b>PROPFIND</b> -  used to retrieve properties, stored as XML, from a web resource. It is also overloaded to allow one to retrieve the collection structure (a.k.a. directory hierarchy) of a remote system.<br>
                                            <b>PROPPATCH</b> - The PROPPATCH method processes instructions specified in the request body to set and/or remove properties defined on the resource identified by the Request-URI.<br>
                                            <b>MKCOL</b> - MKCOL creates a new collection resource at the location specified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI is already mapped to a resource, then the MKCOL MUST fail.<br>
                                            <b>COPY</b> - The COPY method creates a duplicate of the source resource identified by the Request-URI, in the destination resource identified by the URI in the Destination header. The Destination header MUST be present. The exact behavior of the COPY method depends on the type of the source resource.<br>
                                            <b>MOVE</b> - The MOVE operation on a non-collection resource is the logical equivalent of a copy (COPY), followed by consistency maintenance processing, followed by a delete of the source, where all three actions are performed in a single operation. The consistency maintenance step allows the server to perform updates caused by the move, such as updating all URLs, other than the Request-URI that identifies the source resource, to point to the new destination resource.<br>
                                            <b>LOCK</b> - Any resource that supports the LOCK method MUST, at minimum, support the XML request and response formats defined herein. This method is neither idempotent nor safe. <br>
                                            <b>UNLOCK</b> - The UNLOCK method removes the lock identified by the lock token in the Lock-Token request header. The Request-URI MUST identify a resource within the scope of the lock.<br>

                                            <br>Instead of replying with the full contents of the URL, the Web server sends back only the Web page header information (contained inside the HTML HEAD section).
                                            <br><br>
                                            The browser initiates communication with an HTTP server by initiating a TCP connection to the server. Web browsing sessions use server port 80 by default although other ports such as 8080 are sometimes used instead.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Once a session is established, users of Web browsers trigger the sending and receiving of HTTP messages by visiting Web pages that have HTTP (or HTTPS) URLs.

                                            <u>Issues with HTTP</u></b><br>
                                            Messages transmitted over HTTP can fail to be delivered successfully for several reasons:
                                            <br>
                                            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                                                <li>user error</li>
                                                <li>malfunction of the Web browser</li>
                                                <li>malfunction of  the Web server</li>
                                                <li>errors in creation of Web pages</li>
                                                <li>temporary Internet network glitches</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            When these failures occur, the protocol captures the cause of the failure (if possible) and reports an error code back to the browser. Error 404 ("Page not found"), for example, became famous in the early days of the Internet when issues with Web pages and navigation were more common.

                                            <b>Cache-Control</b> - used to specify directives for caching mechanisms in both, requests and responses. Caching directives are unidirectional, meaning that a given directive in a request is not implying that the same directive is to be given in the response.<br>
                                            <b>Connection</b> - The Connection general header controls whether or not the network connection stays open after the current transaction finishes. If the value sent is keep-alive, the connection is persistent and not closed, allowing for subsequent requests to the same server to be done.<br>
                                            <b>Date</b> - The date and time that the message was originated (in "HTTP-date" format as defined by RFC 7231 Date/Time Formats).<br>
                                            <b>Pragma</b> - Implementation-specific fields that may have various effects anywhere along the request-response chain.<br>
                                            <b>Trailer</b> - The Trailer response header allows the sender to include additional fields at the end of chunked messages in order to supply metadata that might be dynamically generated while the message body is sent, such as a message integrity check, digital signature, or post-processing status.<br>
                                            <b>Transfer-Encoding</b> - Transfer-Encoding is a hop-by-hop header, that is applying to a message between two nodes, not to a resource itself. Each segment of a multi-node connection can use different Transfer-Encoding values. If you want to compress data over the whole connection, use the end-to-end header Content-Encoding header instead.<br>
                                            <b>Upgrade</b> - Ask the server to upgrade to another protocol.<br>
                                            <b>Via</b> - Informs the server of proxies through which the request was sent.<br>
                                            <b>Warning</b> - A general warning about possible problems with the entity body.<br><br>

                <p>
                JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as node.js and Apache CouchDB. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
                </br></br>
                The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2018.
                </br></br>
                Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and uses.
